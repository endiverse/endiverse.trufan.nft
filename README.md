The EndiVerse TruFan Loyalty program enables DAO members to mint and maintain a permanant reputation with the Endiverse Community.
This reputation cannot be bought or sold, it must be minted and earned / upgraded by each participant.
Reputation influences voting power and community rewards levels.

This system can be used by any project that want to track a permanant reputation for it's fans.

The EndiVerse DAO uses this system to track seniority levels in the DAO.  Each Level increases the number of votes a user has on measures in the DAO.
The DAO Level is also used to determine payout percentages when profit re-distributions are performed.  Every 6 months, all levels are diminished by 1.  
Level depreciation ansures that the most active participants in the DAO will get the most payout and have the most votes.

The XP leveling system uses a bronze, silver, gold, combined with a military style ranking system.

The Ranking is as follows.

Levels | 1 - 20 | 21 - 40 | 41 - 60 |
