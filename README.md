# TRUFAN.NFT Reference Implementation - Endiverse DAO XP
**Endiverse branded fan loyalty program.**

![Meta-Space](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95392397/159100230-938f0dcb-382d-416c-b371-1f637649abbb.png)

The EndiVerse Loyalty program enables DAO members to mint and maintain a permanant reputation with the Endiverse Community.
This reputation cannot be bought or sold, it must be minted and earned / upgraded by each participant.
Reputation influences voting power and community rewards levels.

This system can be used by any project that want to track a permanant reputation for it's fans.

The EndiVerse DAO uses this system to track seniority levels in the DAO.  Each Level increases the number of votes a user has on measures in the DAO.
The DAO Level is also used to determine payout percentages when profit re-distributions are performed.  Every 6 months, all levels are diminished by 1.  
Level depreciation ansures that the most active participants in the DAO will get the most payout and have the most votes.

Minting & Destroying
EndiVerse Loyalty NFTs are minted by a specific address (minting site coming soon!)  Once minted, new EndiVerse DAO NFTs start at Level 1.
The cost to mint an EndiVerse DAO NFT is TBD.  The funds to mint it are contributed to the DAO treasury to help fund project / operations.

THESE NFTs CANNOT BE BOUGHT OR SOLD!!  - There is some custom code in the Smart Contract that won't allow the NFT to be sold.
You can BURN your DAO NFT Membership permanantly, losing your Rank and Mambership for a TBD refund amount (half the mint cost?)

The XP leveling system uses a bronze, silver, gold, combined with a military style ranking system.

The Ranking is as follows.

Levels | 1 - 20 | 21 - 40 | 41 - 60 |
